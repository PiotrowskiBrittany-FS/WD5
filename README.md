### About
Popcorner is an application that allows users to find popular movies or use a search database to find information on a movie. The search system calls the Movie Database API and finds movie information based on the user's search, even if the user does not recall how to spell the entire movie title. For example, if a user wanted to find a specific Avengers movie, but couldn't recall the full title, the user can type in "Avengers" and find the correct movie based on the search.
### Milestone 3
Milestone 3 focuses on the design and late development of Popcorner. Validation of the user search input and a Route to a new tab will be added to show the most popular movies from the API
